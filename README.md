# 🔢 JavaScript: Set & Map - Concepts & Operations

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding and using **Set** and **Map** in JavaScript. 
These powerful data structures provide efficient ways to store and manage unique values and key-value pairs.

## 1. 📦 Set in JavaScript

- A **Set** is a built-in object that stores **unique values** of any type.
- It automatically removes duplicate values, making it ideal for managing distinct items.
- Sets are **unordered** and do not have indexes like arrays.

---

## 2. 🔗 Operations on Sets: Union & Intersection

- **Union**: Combines all elements from two sets, ensuring uniqueness.
- **Intersection**: Retrieves only elements that are present in **both** sets.
- These operations are commonly used in data analysis, filtering, and comparison tasks.

---

## 3. 🔄 Converting Between Sets and Arrays

- A **Set can be converted to an Array** for access by index or array operations.
- An **Array can be converted to a Set** to remove duplicates and ensure uniqueness.
- These conversions allow flexibility in handling data structures depending on use-case.

## 4. 🛠️ Common Set Methods

- `.add(value)`: Adds a new element to the Set.
- `.delete(value)`: Removes a specific element from the Set.
- `.has(value)`: Checks if a value exists in the Set.
- `.clear()`: Removes all elements from the Set.
- `.size`: Returns the number of elements in the Set.

---

## 5. 🗂️ Map in JavaScript

- A **Map** is a collection of **key-value pairs** where keys can be of any type.
- Unlike objects, Maps maintain the **insertion order** of keys.
- Useful when you need to preserve order or use complex data types as keys.

---

## 6. 🛠️ Common Map Methods

- `.set(key, value)`: Adds or updates a key-value pair.
- `.get(key)`: Retrieves the value for a given key.
- `.has(key)`: Checks if a key exists in the Map.
- `.delete(key)`: Removes a key-value pair.
- `.clear()`: Removes all entries.
- `.size`: Returns the number of key-value pairs.

## 7. 🔁 Iteration Techniques

- **Set**: Can be iterated using `for...of`, `forEach()`, or by accessing its `.values()`.
- **Map**: Can be iterated using `for...of`, `forEach()`, or `.entries()` to access key-value pairs.
- These iteration methods are helpful in performing bulk operations, transforming data, or generating output.
